"# Customer Segmentation with Clustering and MLflow"

\# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Project



This project applies clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using \*\*KMeans\*\*, \*\*DBSCAN\*\*, and \*\*Agglomerative Clustering\*\*.



\## 📊 Features



\- RFM Feature Engineering (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

\- Customer Segmentation using:

&nbsp; - KMeans

&nbsp; - DBSCAN

&nbsp; - Agglomerative Clustering

\- Model Tracking with \*\*MLflow\*\*

\- Visualizations stored and saved

\- Git version control \& DVC integration (coming up)

\- Clean and modular code



\## 🛠️ Tools \& Libraries



\- Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib)

\- MLflow for experiment tracking

\- Git + GitHub for version control

\- Jupyter Notebook

\- DVC (coming up next)
